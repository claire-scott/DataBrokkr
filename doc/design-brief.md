# High-Level Design Document for a Modern Modular ETL/ELT System

## Overview
This document outlines the design of a **modular, open-source ETL/ELT system** that balances **ease of use**, **scalability**, and **extensibility** while being friendly to contributors. The system will provide a **drag-and-drop control plane** (similar to SSIS) and a **modular data flow engine** supporting ELT transformations, task orchestration, and schema-aware data movement using **Parquet as the core data format**.

## Key Features
- **Web-based UI (React + Drag-and-Drop Workflow Editor)**
- **Python Backend with FastAPI for APIs and Task Execution**
- **Modular Architecture** (Pluggable Sources, Sinks, Processing Nodes, and Auth Modules)
- **Hybrid ETL/ELT Support** (Execute SQL in databases when possible, process locally when needed)
- **RBAC, Secrets Management, and Logging**
- **Extensible Plugin System for Community Contributions**
- **Lightweight Deployment Options (Docker, Kubernetes, Serverless)**

---

## Architecture Overview

### 1. **Frontend (React + Next.js)**
- **UI Components**
  - **Drag-and-Drop Workflow Editor** (Allows users to visually construct ETL pipelines)
  - **Pipeline Dashboard** (Monitors executions, failures, and logs)
  - **Data Lineage Visualization** (Tracks data movement and transformations)
  - **Access Control UI** (Manages RBAC and permissions)
  
- **Frontend Technologies**
  - React + Next.js
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - shadcn/ui components
  - WebSockets for real-time updates

---

### 2. **Backend (Python + FastAPI)**
- **Core API Services:**
  - **Workflow Orchestration API** (Handles DAG execution and scheduling)
  - **Plugin Registry API** (Manages installed sources, sinks, and processors)
  - **Metadata & Lineage API** (Tracks schema evolution and data flow tracking)
  - **Auth & RBAC API** (Manages user authentication and access control)
  
- **Execution Engine:**
  - **Task Queue & Scheduling** (Celery + Redis or Temporal.io for orchestration)
  - **Distributed Execution Support** (Support for local execution, Kubernetes jobs, or serverless functions)
  
- **Secrets Management:**
  - Uses **Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault**
  - Secrets never exposed in logs or UI

---

### 3. **Modular ETL/ELT Processing Framework**
#### **Pluggable Components**
1. **Data Sources (Extractors)**
   - SQL Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Snowflake, BigQuery, SQL Server
   - APIs: REST, GraphQL, gRPC
   - Streaming: Kafka, MQTT, WebSockets
   - File-based: Parquet, CSV, JSON, Avro

2. **Data Processing Steps (Transformations)**
   - SQL Execution (ELT push-down where possible)
   - Python-based Transformations (Pandas, PySpark for complex processing)
   - Schema Validation & Data Quality Checks
   - Aggregations, Joins, and Deduplication

3. **Data Sinks (Loaders)**
   - Relational Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Snowflake, Redshift
   - Cloud Storage: S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage
   - Message Brokers: Kafka, Redis Streams, RabbitMQ
   - Data Warehouses: BigQuery, Databricks, Fabric Lakehouse

4. **Execution & Scheduling**
   - Manual Run, Scheduled Execution (Cron-style), Event-Driven Execution
   - Support for CI/CD Integration (Trigger pipelines on Git commits, API calls, or event streams)

---

### 4. **Authentication & Access Control**
- **Auth Options**: OAuth2, Microsoft Entra, Google Auth, LDAP
- **RBAC Support**: Fine-grained access to pipelines, logs, and metadata
- **Audit Logging**: Logs all access and modifications to pipelines and data

---

### 5. **Observability & Logging**
- **Real-time Logs & Debugging** (Structured JSON logs, query logs, transformation logs)
- **Metrics Collection** (Pipeline run times, data volume processed, failures, retries)
- **Alerting & Notifications** (Slack, Microsoft Teams, PagerDuty, Email)
- **Data Lineage Tracking** (Which data came from where and what transformations were applied)

---

### 6. **Deployment & Scaling**
#### **Lightweight Deployment**
- **Docker Compose** for single-node deployments
- **Kubernetes Helm Chart** for scalable, production-ready deployments
- **Serverless Mode** (Optional) using AWS Lambda, Azure Functions

#### **Infrastructure Components**
- **Task Queue**: Celery or Temporal.io
- **Metadata Storage**: PostgreSQL (or lightweight SQLite for local testing)
- **Distributed Execution**: Kubernetes Jobs or Worker Nodes (optional)
- **Storage**: S3-compatible object storage for data persistence

---

## **Extensibility & Contribution Model**
This system is designed to be **open-source friendly**, allowing easy community contributions.

ðŸ”¹ **Plugin System for Extending Sources, Sinks, & Processors**  
- Developers can contribute new **connectors** (new sources, sinks, or transformations) as separate modules.
- Uses a **standardized API** for defining custom processing nodes.
- Supports **hot-reloading** of plugins (no need for full restarts).

ðŸ”¹ **Configuration via YAML & UI**  
- Pipelines can be defined using **a UI drag-and-drop editor** or a **YAML/JSON DSL**.
- Allows both **low-code (UI-based) and high-code (Python/SQL scripting) users**.

ðŸ”¹ **Community Governance & Roadmap**  
- Maintains an **open RFC process** for suggesting new features.
- Uses **GitHub Discussions & Issues** for collaboration.

---

## **Example Workflow**
### **Pipeline: Enrich Sales Data & Load to Data Warehouse**
1. Extract sales data from **PostgreSQL**.
2. Fetch additional product metadata via **REST API**.
3. Join & clean the data (deduplication, currency conversion) in **Pandas**.
4. Validate schema consistency and detect missing fields.
5. Store the cleaned dataset as **Parquet** in an **S3 bucket**.
6. Push the final transformed dataset to **Snowflake** for analysis.
7. Notify stakeholders via **Slack if pipeline fails**.

---

## **Next Steps**
1. Define **MVP Scope** (Start with core UI, backend APIs, and a few key connectors).
2. Create **Proof-of-Concept (PoC)** for workflow execution engine.
3. Build **drag-and-drop UI prototype** in React.
4. Establish **GitHub repo, contributor guide, and community discussions**.

---

## **Final Thoughts**
This system fills a **major market gap** between **enterprise-heavy tools (Airflow, Azure Data Factory) and lightweight tools (dbt, Prefect)** by providing:
âœ… **A visual, drag-and-drop SSIS-style UI** for easy adoption.  
âœ… **Modular Python-based backend** for power users.  
âœ… **Hybrid ETL/ELT workflows** that balance flexibility & efficiency.  
âœ… **An open-source, contributor-friendly approach** to extensibility.
